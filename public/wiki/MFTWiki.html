            <p class="w3-large">The main memory must accommodate both the operating system and the
                various user processes. We therefore need to allocate main memory in the most
                efficient way possible.MFT (Multiprogramming with a Fixed number of Tasks) is one of the old memory management techniques in which the memory is partitioned into fixed size partitions and each job is assigned to a partition.
                The memory assigned to a partition does not change.</p>
            <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium"><b><u>Advantages</u></b>: Since the partition is fixed it is possible to know the base address of the process whe address space in memory is being allocated thus,At the time of compilation only the address of each word can be given. Or we can bind address at the compile time.<br>
                <b><u>Disadvantages</u></b>: Degree of multiprogramming is rigid ,its is not flexible because we cannot  change the no. of blocks. memory wastage is caused due to fragmentation.<br>
                There are two types of fragmentation, namely: <br>1.Internal: the size of hte process is smaller than the size of the partition allocated to it thus there will be,Partial or Incomplete usage of a block of memory resulting in Internal Fragmentation<br>2.External: The blocks whose sizes are to small to accomodate the processes are not occupied, thus Entire block of available memory cannot be used which is termed as external fragmentation.</p>

            <h4>Best Fit</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The best fit deals with allocating the smallest free partition which meets the requirement of the requesting process. This algorithm first searches the entire list of free partitions and considers the smallest one. The main objective of doing best fit is to avoid or minimize internal fragmentation.</p><br>

            <h4>First Fit</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">In the first fit approach is to allocate the first free partition large enough which can accommodate the process. It finishes after finding the first suitable free partition. The main advantage of this algorithm is fast run time and can be used in time critical systems. This algorithm does not take into consideration the size of the partition or the resultant fragmentation which results of picking the first available slot.</p><br>

            <h4>Worst Fit</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">In worst fit approach is to locate largest available free partition capable of accomodating the process. Its behaviour is complementary to that of best fit. The main use of worst fit algorithms is in MVT as it allows larger free space for the processes in the job pool resulting in increasing degree of multiprogramming.</p><br>
